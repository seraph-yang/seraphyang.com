title: CarbonQuestX
description: I am a member of CarbonQuestX, a team currently competing in the $100M Carbon Removal contest. Our solution utilizes the electrodialysis of dirty water in hopes to sequester carbon dioxide for at least 100 years. Additionally, we globalized our solution by sharing it with other teams in the UAE and South Korea. I specifically work on the mechanical subteam, modeling and building the components of our reaction module.
