## Abstract
Emotion detection through facial expression analysis has significant applications in various domains such as job interviews, therapy, and healthcare. This research investigates different machine learning (ML) algorithms for Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) using the FER2013 dataset with the goal of identifying the most effective approach. Preprocessing techniques involving landmark detection and Euclidean distance computation were employed to capture spatial relationships within facial features. Decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms were tested, with CNN emerging as the most promising. The CNN model demonstrated superior performance in emotion detection, paving the way for advancements in human-computer interaction and emotional intelligence.

## Introduction
Facial expressions serve as vital cues for understanding human emotions. In recent years, advancements in computer vision and machine learning have enabled automated facial emotion recognition, offering immense potential across various domains. This research explores different ML algorithms to detect emotions accurately from facial expressions, aiming to enhance the capabilities of Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) technology. By investigating the effectiveness of various algorithms using the FER2013 dataset, we strive to contribute to the advancement of emotion detection systems for practical applications such as job interviews, therapy, and healthcare.

The FER2013 dataset was utilized in this study, comprising labeled facial images categorized into seven different emotions. Preprocessing involved the use of dlib to detect 68 facial landmarks, allowing for precise localization of key facial points. Euclidean distance was then computed between these landmarks to capture spatial relationships within facial features, enhancing the discriminative power of the extracted features for emotion detection tasks.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Tested

1. **Decision Tree**: Decision trees were employed as a baseline approach for emotion detection. However, they exhibited signs of overfitting, leading to suboptimal performance.

2. **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression models were trained to predict emotions based on extracted facial features. Despite their simplicity, logistic regression models struggled to capture the complex relationships within the data.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN algorithm was tested to leverage the idea of similarity among data points. However, it demonstrated limited generalization capability, resulting in mediocre performance in emotion detection tasks.

4. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: CNN emerged as the most promising algorithm for FER. The hierarchical architecture of CNNs allowed them to automatically learn relevant features from raw facial data, resulting in superior performance compared to other tested algorithms.
