- Competed on my school's [XPRIZE](https://xprize.org) team where we competed in the $100M carbon removal competition.
- Our solution utilized the electrodialysis of dirty water to sequester carbon from it for 100 years.
- On the team, I worked on the mechanical side, where I helped 3D model and CAD the reaction chamber, solder and assemble electronics, and research and build the components of the final solution.
